# todo-web-app

This project is the technical challenge for CERN position BE-CSS-CSA-2024-216-GRAP.

Original author: Bartek Urbaniec

# Security

All routes require authentication and some require authorization. HTTP Basic auth is used.

This program does not include user management, it uses hard-coded users defined in `TodoApplication.java`.

# Endpoints

## POST /categories

Creates a category. Needs `ADMIN` role.

Expects JSON with the following structure: `{"name" : "Name of category", "description" : "Category description"}`

# Original README contents

This is a skeleton of Spring Boot application which should be used as a start point to create a working one.
The goal of this task is to create simple REST API  which allows users to manage TODOs. 
The API should allow to create/delete/update TODOs and categories as well as search for user, name, description, deadline and category in any combination. *For example find all todos for an user X where deadline is today and name contains test.* 
The API should also implement basic authorization/authentication: *User X cannot access TODOs of user Y as long as he doesn't have admin role.*

You are free to use any library or testing framework in the project.
